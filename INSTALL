Build instructions:

I have been working on Centos 6 to date.

See also http://www.openmirage.org (if it is up) or 
https://github.com/avsm/mirage-www 

1. Build/install OCaml, http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/

2. Check out mirage, https://github.com/avsm/mirage

Build and install it (by default into ~/mir-inst):
> cd mirage
> make
> make install

Add the install/bin directory to PATH, e.g.
PATH=~/mir-inst/bin:${PATH}
export PATH

3. Compile
> cd mirageserver
> make
By default unix-socket target is built for at present.

4. Run
> ./_build/unix-socket/server.bin

5. Access, e.g. http://localhost:8080/
(Port is configured in server.ml; IP addresses for mirage direct
mode are also configured here - no current build target for that though)
