First explorations with Mirage, towards creating simple web application(s).
Initially based on the mirage-tutorial Http server example (stripped down
and commented).

Initially just with the unix-socket target option as far as the build is
concerned.

So basic server works. 

Exercise 2: a simple location-based 'game' server.
2.1: Allow client(s) to create 'session's, tagged with name, location name, 
lat/long/radius, timeout.
Allow client(s) to search for sessions (all, eventually by location/range).

2.2: Allow client(s) to publish their existence/location in a session with
name, lat/long, timeout.
Allow client(s) to query a session for info from other client(s).

2.3: allow client(s) to subscribe/resubscribe to changes in a session, 
with timeout.
Allow client(s) to poll for changes.
